# Tic-Tac-Toe
This C++ program implements a simple command-line version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective markers ('X' or 'O'). The game starts with player 1 choosing their marker, and then the players alternate turns, selecting slots numbered 1 through 9 to place their marker.
